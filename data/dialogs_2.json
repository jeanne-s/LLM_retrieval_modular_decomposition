I wish I could say the same. I just found out I have to give a presentation next week, and public speaking terrifies me. I'm not sure how I'm going to get through it. Alice: (Encouragingly) Oh, Bob, I know how daunting that can feel. But remember the last time you were nervous about presenting? You ended up doing a fantastic job. Everyone was impressed. Bob: (Still worried) Thanks, Alice. But it feels different this time. I keep imagining all the things that could go wrong. What if I freeze up or forget what to say?",
